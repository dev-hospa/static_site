Summary: This is a summary of the first post written for our Pelican Blog. We're using this for 100DaysOfWeb course.


##Big heading for a big day!

This is the first pharagraph of article - whoooo!

We're writing this in Markdown format so we can use:
two * symbols to indicate a **bold** formatted block of text.


###A slightly smaller header...

We can also use a single * around a block of text to indicate an *italic* word.

THE END! (Cool story bro!)
